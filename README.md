# CG-Assignment

In this project we are simulating one of the natural phenomena which occurs in our
Universe, which is “Solar Eclipse” using the OpenGL concepts. A solar eclipse occurs when 
a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially 
blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned which is implemented in C/C++ using OpenGL, 
GLU and GLUT libraries.It consists of an animation of specific time duration controlled by the 
Keyboards Click Event Handling.
